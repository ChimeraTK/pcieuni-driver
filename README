                             The DAMC Linux device driver
                             
The DAMC device driver designed to provide access to the memmory and IO space of the DAMC module.
As well to make DMA transfer from DAMC module to host memmory space.

Installation:
The driver file should to be installed in the /lib/modules/`uname -r'/ directory.
Call "depmod -a" and try the driver calling "modprobe damc"
The driver during loading creates the "damc" class in /sys/class and device nodes damcsX in /dev 
directory. There X is a slot number in which the module is installed. To have standart device names 
(for example damc0 or damc1) one should create udev rules.

Creating udev rules (Ubuntu for other Linux versions read the udev manual):
1. add this line to the /etc/udev/permissions.rules:
# DAMC modules
SUBSYSTEM=="damc",      MODE="066" 

2.add lines to the /etc/udev/rules.d/60-symlinks.rules
    #rules to create damc device nodes
    KERNEL=="damcs3",     SYMLINK="damc1"
    KERNEL=="damcs1",     SYMLINK="damc2"
    KERNEL=="damcs2",     SYMLINK="damc0"
    
Using the driver:
The example code is damc_pagetest.cpp or damc_dmatest.cpp.

To read and write to and from memmory or IO spave of the module use read and write system calls with
device_rw structe as an argument. This structe defined in the damc_fn.h:
struct device_rw  {
       u_int		offset_rw;  /*offset in address*/
       u_int		data_rw;     /*data to set or returned read data */
       u_int		mode_rw;   /*mode of rw (RW_D8, RW_D16, RW_D32)*/
       u_int 	barx_rw;     /*BARx (0, 1, 2, 3)*/
};
